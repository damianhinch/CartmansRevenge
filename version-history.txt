Version 0.1

2012/08/22
-Created screen and basic shapes for characters
2012/08/25
-Basic movement of the monsters and player. Character leaves a trail of rectangles behind
	him and the monster cannot travel outside of the rectangle tunnel. Monsters are controlled
	manually by user using W,A,S,D keys.
2012/08/28
-All objects put into classes. Monsters do not track the player but move autonomously, navigating
	their way through the maze of tunnels - using a basic movement algorithm.
012/08/29
-Monsters now chase the player through the maze and when they catch him the game ends. If in a dead end tunnel,
	they become stuck in preparation for transition in disembodied state to neighbouring tunnel.

-Functionality as per version 0.13. Screen size set to 50x50 squares in grid, with earth textures and layers represented.
